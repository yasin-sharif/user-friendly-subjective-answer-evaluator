## Results and Impact
This project provides the faculty with an easy to use evaluator with interactive user interface. Importantly the capability to evaluate the papers offline. It also provides high performance evaluation nearly as an experienced faculty in a domain within few seconds to save their time and effort, this model also works independent of domain, allowing it to use for a broad range. Finally, the capability to format response automatically and load responses automatically reduces the faculty burden even further.
